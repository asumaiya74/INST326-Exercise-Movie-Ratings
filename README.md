# Background

The  goal  of  this  exercise  is  to  practice  merging  DataFrames  and  using  split-apply-combine  to analyze data. For this exercise, you will read in data about movies and ratings of those movies, and you will find the highest-rated movies in the dataset.

# About the data
The  data  are  derived  from  the  MovieLens  100k  dataset,  available  at  https://www.kaggle.com/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset.  Two  files  are  provided:  **movies.csv**  and  **ratings.csv** **movies.csv** contains  information  about  a  number  of  movies,  and  **ratings.csv**  contains  users'  ratings  of  these movies. There are several ratings for each movie.

# Template
A  template  script, **movies.py**,  is  provided.  This  script  contains  import  statements,  a  **parse_args()** function  to  process  command-line  arguments,  and  an  **if __name__ == "__main__()":**  statement  to run the program.

# Instructions
**best_movies() function**

Write a function called best_movies() with two parameters: the path to a file of movie data (such as movies.csv) and the path to a file of rating data (such as ratings.csv).

Your  function  should  read  each  CSV  file  into  its  own  DataFrame.  Do  not  hard-code  the  filenames into your function; use the parameters you defined instead. Merge the DataFrames using the "item id"  column  of  the  ratings  DataFrame  and  the  "movie  id"  column  of  the  movie  DataFrame.  This should be an inner merge.

Group by the "movie title" column and find the average (mean) value of the "rating" column. This should give you a Series where the index labels are movie titles and the values are average ratings. Store this Series in a variable.

Return a sorted version of your Series of average ratings by appending .sort_values(ascending=False)  to  the  name  of  your  variable.  For  example,  if  you  used  the  variable name average_ratings, your return statement could be
  > return average_ratings.sort_values(ascending=False)

This will sort the values in your Series from highest-rated movie to lowest-rated.

# Running your script
Your script should require two command-line arguments. Assuming your script is called movies.py and  is  in  the  same  directory  as  movies.csv  and  ratings.csv,  and  assuming  this  is  the  working directory of your terminal, hereâ€™s how you could run your script (Windows users, replace "python3" with "python"):

  > python3 movies.py movies.csv ratings.csv

The  top-most  rated  movie  in  this  dataset  is  "Close  Shave,  A  (1995)"  with  an  average  rating  of 4.491071.
